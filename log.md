# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 18 July, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started the pricing toggle challenge from Front End Mentor. 

**Thoughts:** I had fun, though I didn't get stretched too far outside of my comfort zone today.

### Day 2: 19 July, 2020

**Today's Progress:** I switched the toggler from a basic button to a styled checkbox. I also made it to so that the prices would change when using the arrow keys.

**Thoughts:** Biggest challenges were in some fiddly CSS bits, which was surprising. The hardest part was knowing what event listener to use for the checkbox.

### Day 3: 20 July, 2020

**Today's Progress:** I only had an hour, so I worked on the Social Media Dashboard challenge from Front End Mentor. I had started it a month or so ago, but had gotten bored after doing the Javascript first. 

**Thoughts:** After taking a break from this I found that I still had fun working on this. I realised that my plan of doing everything as borders was not a good one since I could not do the gradient for Instagram. I ended up having to switch it to a before element.

### Day 4: 21 July, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Worked on the styling for the Social Media Dashboard. A lot of tedious HTML.

**Thoughts:** It was tedious but I am looking forward to finishing tomorrow and working on something else.

### Day 5: 22 July, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I finished the Social Media Dashboard from Frontend Mentor. I ended up completely switching the theme toggle from using data attributed to just having a light and a dark class. I was encountering issues with the checkbox remembering if it was ticked before page refresh, so I set it so that it would set the theme on page load as well as on the clicking of the toggle.

In the afternoon I designed a page for a Magic 8 Ball, and coded the design for it. I haven't had time to start on the Javascript but have written the pseudo code.

**Thoughts:** I had fun today. I was able to get in the zone, and I finally had time to work on it for more than an hour. I was going to work towards finishing the Beginner Javascript course, but in the end decided I needed something that would test me more on what I have already learnt.

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
