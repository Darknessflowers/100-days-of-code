# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 18 July, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started the pricing toggle challenge from Front End Mentor. 

**Thoughts:** I had fun, though I didn't get stretched too far outside of my comfort zone today.

### Day 2: 19 July, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I switched the toggler from a basic button to a styled checkbox. I also made it to so that the prices would change when using the arrow keys.

**Thoughts:** Biggest challenges were in some fiddly CSS bits, which was surprising. The hardest part was knowing what event listener to use for the checkbox.

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
